# Imp City

Imp city is an underground city building game. Your goal is to create an attractive 
underground city to attract creatures which will work for you. With enough creatures
at hand, you can send expedictions to the upper world to find treasures and valuable
artifacts. The upper world is dangerous though, so make sure your expedition teams are
well equipped and trained.

## Manual

Once I started a manual over there. Outdated, but better than nothing, I guess:
https://gedankenweber.wordpress.com/imp-city-underground-creature-keeping/

Since summer 2025 there is an effort to change part of the economy from valuabale 
metals to mana. Mana is generated by your creatures if they work in your undergound
city. Mana is consumbed if you give your creatures orders, and in general to pay
for the upkeep of your rooms.

## Technical

### Build and run

Since 2023-10-17 there is now an automated way to create a runnable distribution for Linux from the contents of the repository.

1) Open a terminal, cd into the top level directory of the project
2) Run "./gradlew createDistribution"
3) In the directory app/build/imp_city-vXYZ-linux there should now be a runnable distribution
4) It can be started with the start.sh script
