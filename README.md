There was a long break since 2018, but recently I felt some motivation to continue thios project. So here it is, in a brand new repository and updated to Java 11.

The build process is also new, now using gradle, and making release bundles is, well, totally untested so far. 

Still if I made no mistakes it should suffice to get the release bundle for your operationg system (Windows, Linux), unpack it and run "start.bat" or "start.sh" respectively.

Consider this project to be in some sort of alpha state after the long break and all the changes.

Once I started a manual over there. Better than nothing, I guess:
